# Open Projects

I’m working on a range of open-source projects designed to innovate and inspire, including the following:
* [OpenAir](https://qr.net/openairproject) ► pneumatics designs
* [OpenArm](https://qr.net/openarmproject) ► robotic arm (long term) design
* [OpenBox](https://qr.net/openboxproject) ► modular designs from steel boxes
* [OpenGrow](https://qr.net/opengrowproject) ► hydroponics & aquaponics designs
* [OpenJar](https://qr.net/openjarproject) ► modular designs based on mason jars
* [OpenLab](https://qr.net/openlabproject) ► designs for multidisciplinary engineering labs
* [OpenME](https://qr.net/openmeproject) ► a full archive of mechanical engineering bachelors degree
* [OpenSpin](https://qr.net/openspinproject) ► modular designs for bearings & rotary functions

Each project reflects my commitment to creativity, accessibility, and practical solutions for multidisciplinary needs.  Don't forget to use the search function in the navigation bar (left hand) of these project pages to find what you need!  All the contributors and I are trying hard to comment with relevant keywords at each section as we get these pages populated!

# Robotics development

SCUTTLE Robotics is the organization I founded (including businesses: LLC & PLT, and including open-source community aspects.)  SCUTTLE is my largest project, but it shares elements with all of the other projects (mechanical, electrical, software designs).  The SCUTTLE robot is a mobile robot for 1) teaching university students, 2) performing robotics research, and 3) development of industrial solutions, even forming businesses beginning with the SCUTTLE platform.  To describe it, we have sometimes called it "a Raspberry Pi on Wheels" because the outcomes and audiences span so widely, just like Raspberry Pi.
